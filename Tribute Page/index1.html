            <p>Tim Berners-Lee is an English engineer and computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He was born on June 8, 1955, in London, England. Tim studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class degree in physics.</p>
            <p>In 1989, while working at CERN, Berners-Lee proposed an information management system that would eventually become the World Wide Web. He implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet. The World Wide Web was introduced to the public on August 6, 1991.</p>
            <p>Tim's vision for the web was as a platform for collaboration, information sharing, and the democratization of knowledge. He is a strong advocate for net neutrality and open access to the internet.</p>
